  <h1>In the following exercises, you will be asked to complete a series of CSS katas</h1>

  <p>In order to complete each exercise you will need to build your component to match the accompanying image. How you choose to accomplish that is entirely up to you. Remember: there are many ways to achieve the same goal.</p>

  <p>Hone and focus your approaches. As you progress you may pick up another CSS technique that you feel would be of benefit on earlier katas, so take some time to experiment and find different approaches to the same problem. Ask yourself: <q>Is browser backwards compatibility important to me in this situation?</q>, <q>should I try to make this component reusable elsewhere?</q>, <q>if I were to change the markup would my component break?</q></p>

  <h2>Running the test suite</h2>

  <p>Consult the README for setup and installation instructions. If you have successfully done this you should be reading these instructions at the address <a href="http://localhost:7000/app/index.html">http://localhost:7000/app/index.html</a>.</p>

  <p>Follow each of the katas. While you do not need to take them in order, the CSS you build will be cumulative and have an affect on other pages in this application.</p>

  <p>Each of the components you will work on will be nested inside a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag. Sometimes you will be provided with some boilerplate markup to get you started. Add whatever styling hooks you feel are appropriate to achieve the task. <em>Remember you are encouraged come back to the kata and try new and different approaches</em>.</p>

  <p>While whatever markup is inside each <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tag is allowed to be changed, try not to change markup outside of these sections or the section's id attribute.</p>

  <p>Write your CSS in the file <code>app/answers.css</code>. As you write and save your HTML and CSS the browser should automatically refresh and display how the CSS affect the display.</p>

  <p>After each test, in a new command line tab, run the command <code>npm run test</code>. This will compare each of the katas and provide you with a comparison report outlining the visual difference between your component and the expected outcome.</p>

  <p>As you progress, you will see that some elements outside of the code sections will begin to alter in appearance. This is intentional and should be embraced as an integral part of CSS development. <em>You will not be tested on these parts of the application</em>.</p>
